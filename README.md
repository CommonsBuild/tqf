## Background

The Token Engineering Commons has been running community Quadratic Funding on
the Grants Stack since the Beta round of April 2023. Since the inception of the
Token Engineering Grants Rounds
([TEGR](https://forum.tecommons.org/c/grants-program/32)), an experimental
feature was introduced called subject matter expertise signal boosting
([SMESB](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23)).
In SMESB donations weights are boosted according to a SME boost weight assigned
to donor addresses. In TEGR, donor weights are computed as a combination of TE
academy credentials and $TEC token holdings. These signals are meant to
indicate expertise in the field of Token Engineering.

For more information on the background of TQF, see the original blog post:  
[Incorporating Expertise into Quadratic Funding.](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23)


## Purpose

The purpose of this research repository is to provide a data science research
environment to the operators of the TEGR rounds and a tool for other community
round operators that wish to employ the techniques being highlighted as tunable
quadratic funding.

Prospective Benefits of Tunable Quadratic Funding Include:
* Increased Sybil Resistance
* Subject Matter Expertise Signal Boosting
* Community Token Signal Processing
* Pluralistic Framework for Analysing Funding Public Goods
* Platform for Quadratic Funding Research Education and Communication

The TQF tool allows for stepping through the process of quadratic funding and
understanding the deeper implications of applying token signals as boosts to
donations. This process allows communities to explore the alignment between
resource allocation and values. As a general contribution to public goods
tooling, we expect this tool to aid in attracting funding to the domain of
token engineering public goods and the greater public goods funding ecosystem.

## Scope of the Project

Proposed Delivery for Q1 2024:  
* A paper or extensive forum post with our findings, recommendations and a
framework to tune QF at the end of this proposalâ€™s period.
* An open-sourced MVP tool for all operators to be able to tune QF.
* Training materials that allow grant operators to confidently apply tunable QF
to their community grants rounds.

## Adding a New Round
The framework takes in donation datasets, token distributions, a grants
dataset, and user input to compute the final funding allocation for each
project.

The operations required to utilize TQF are the following:
1. Input a donation dataset
2. Input token distribution datasets
3. Input a grant names dataset
4. Configure the parameters of your boosts
5. Output funding allocation results

The following sections describe the required datasets and their required
columns. Datasets may have additional columns that are not required. Columns
do not need to be in any particular order in the dataset.

Datasets should be added to the `tqf/tqf/input` directory.

### Grants Dataset
This csv is a list of eligible grants in your round.

        columns={"Grant Name", "Grant Address"},

Example: 

Note, if your donations dataset has a 'Grant Name' column, then you do not need
to provide this dataset.

### Donations Dataset
This csv contains all of the donations made in your round.

        columns={"voter", "amountUSD", "grantAddress"},

Example: 

### Token Distribution Dataset
This csv represents a token as a mapping from address to balance.

        columns={"address", "balance"}

Example: 

### Wiring The New Round
Once you have added your datasets to the `tqf/tqf/input` directory, you
need to wire the new round to the tqf app. You can start by copying tegr3.

```bash
cp tqf/tegr/tegr3.py tqf/tegr/my_round.py
```

### Edit my_round.py
Change the filenames to match the datasets that you have added to
`tqf/tqf/input`. Set the default parameters for tuning as you desire.
```python
# Donations
donations = Donations(
    name="xxx Donations",
    file="tqf/input/xxx.csv",
    grant_names_dataset="tqf/input/xxx.csv",
)

# Donations Dashboard
donations_dashboard = DonationsDashboard(donations=donations)

# Token Distribution
token_distribution = TokenDistribution(
    file="tqf/input/xxx.csv", name="xxx Token"
)

# Token Boost
token_boost = Boost(
    name="xxx Token Boost",
    distribution=token_distribution,
    transformation="LogLinear",
    max_boost=8,
    threshold=10,
)

# Repeat for as many token boosts as needed
# ...

# Boost Factory
boost_factory = BoostFactory(
    name="xxx Boost Factory",
    boosts=[token_boost],
    boost_factor=8,
    combine_method="product",
)

# Tunable Quadratic Funding
qf = TunableQuadraticFunding(
    donations_dashboard=donations_dashboard,
    boost_factory=boost_factory,
    mechanism="Cluster Mapping",
    matching_pool=50_000,
    matching_percentage_cap=0.15,
)

# Assemble the app with sidebar
app = pn.template.MaterialTemplate(
    title="Tunable Quadratic Funding: xxx",
    sidebar=[boost.param for boost in boost_factory.boosts]
    + [boost_factory.param]
    + [qf.param],
)

# Add tabs to the main view
app.main += [
    pn.Tabs(
        (
            "Charts",
            pn.Column(
                boost_factory.view_boost_outputs_chart,
                qf.view_qf_matching_bar,
            ),
        ),
        (
            "Data",
            qf.view_results,
        ),
        active=0,
    )
]

```

### Add my_round to __main__.py

Add an option to click:
```python
    type=click.Choice(["tegr1", "tegr2", "tegr3", "all", "my_round"], case_sensitive=False),
```

Add my_round case to main():
```python
# in main()
    if round == "my_round":
        if cli:
            from tqf.tegr.my_round import qf

            print(tegr1_qf.view_results(tabulator=False, to_csv=True))
        else:
            from tqf.tegr.my_round import app

            pn.serve(app.servable(), port=port, show=False, admin=admin)
```

### Running your round
To display round results based on the default parameters and save results to `tqf/tqf/output/results.csv`:
```bash
python -m tqf -r my_round -c
```

To run the app in the browser for interactively tuning parameters:
```bash
python -m tqf -r my_round
```

## Specification

### Quadratic Funding

Quadratic Funding is a capital allocation protocol that determines the
distribution of matching funds across a set of public goods projects. The 
algorithm determines the funding outcome based off of peer to peer contributions
that are made from citizens to public goods. Formally:

```math
\mathbf{F}_p = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{c_{ip}} \right)^2
```

Where $`\mathbf{F}_{p}`$ is the quadratic funding for project $`p`$ and $`c_{ip}`$ is the contribution made 
by citizen $`c_i`$ to project $`p`$ where there are $`n`$ citizens. In matrix notation, QF is an operation that maps a contributions matrix
$`\mathbf{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}`$ to a funding vector $`\mathbf{F} \in
\mathbb{R}^{m}`$ given $`m`$ public goods projects. 

```math
\mathbf{F} = \left( \text{sum}\left( \sqrt{\mathbf{C}} \right) \right)^2
```

The contributions matrix is
radicalized element wise and then project columns are summed on axis 0. The
resulting vector is squared element wise to give the quadratic funding per
project. The funding outcome is then normalized such that it sums to 1 and represents a
distribution to be made by the matching pool.


### Contributor Boost Coefficient

Tunable QF introduces a contributor boost coefficient $`b_i`$ for each citizen
$`c_i`$  that is applied as a multiplicative factor to each donation $`c_{ip}`$ for
each public good $`p`$, such that the resulting funding mechanism becomes:



```math
\mathbf{F}_p = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{b_i\cdot{c_{ip}}} \right)^2
```


In matrix notation, we are applying the boost vector $`\mathbf{B} \in
\mathbb{R}^{n}`$ as a coefficient for the contribution matrix.


```math
\mathbf{F} = \left( \sqrt{\mathbf{B}^T}\cdot{\sqrt{\mathbf{C}}}  \right)^2
```

Notice above that we do not need the sum operator anymore due to the nature of vector matrix multiplication.


### Token Balances

Consider a token distribution dataset as a vector $`\mathbf{T} \in 
\mathbb{Z}^{n+}`$ such that $`\mathbf{T_i}`$ is the balance of $`c_i`$.

<div align="center">
<center>

| Address                           | Balance |
|-----------------------------------|---------|
| 0x456...abc                       | 200     |
| 0x123...def                       | 100     |
| ...                               | ...     |

</center>
</div>

The dataset can represent fungible or non-fungible tokens.


### Token Signaling

Given a token distribution, a boost vector can be created using a
signal transformation.

 The donor coefficients are applied to the donations as part of the QF
 calculation, ensuring that each donor's influence is weighted according to the
 community-defined boost vector $B$.

The framework is flexible and can accommodate various methods of determining
the donor coefficients, such as:

- Historical contribution analysis
- Token holdings snapshots
- Community voting mechanisms
- Other custom algorithms designed by the community

By providing this level of customization, TQF empowers communities to experiment with and optimize their funding mechanisms, leading to more equitable and effective public goods funding.
